Data employed in our papers cannot be freely shared. Nevertheless, we are happy to share our scripts. The repository contains the following files:
- Analysis.ipynb, which contains most of the regression and clustering analysis;
- BonaventuraMethod.ipynb, which contains the method proposed by [Bonaventura et al. (2020)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-57209-w) applied on our data;
- NetworkFormation.ipynb, which describes how we have built our networks;
- NetworkPlot.ipynb, which replicates Figure 1 in Esposito et al. (2022).

Finally, the folder "networks" contains all the network snapshots produced in our analysis.
